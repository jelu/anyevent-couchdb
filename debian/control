Description: a non-blocking CouchDB client based on jquery.couch.js
 AnyEvent::CouchDB is a non-blocking CouchDB client implemented on top of the
 AnyEvent framework.  Using this library will give you the ability to run
 many CouchDB requests asynchronously, and it was intended to be used within
 a Coro+AnyEvent environment.  However, it can also be used synchronously
 if you want.
 .
 Its API is based on jquery.couch.js, but we've adapted the API slightly so that
 it makes sense in an asynchronous Perl environment.
